Often underused or forgotten rsync is one of the most useful tools on Unix/Linux systems (including OS X and now Windows via [WSL](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-au/commandline/wsl/about)). Able to accomplish most file operations traditionally done with mv, cp or scp on both local and remote systems. Rsync can supercharge your day to day file operations with incremental copies, detailed progress and transit compression without changing your workflow.
